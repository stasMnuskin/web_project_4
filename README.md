This project is the first out of three and about implementing basic JS. I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

"Around The U.S" is a my fourth independent project in the Practicum100 program. This is a one web page made only with html, css and some basic JavaScript.
It has 4 unique sections!
more to that, it is well structured according to BEM principles.
