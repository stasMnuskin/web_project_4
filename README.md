**Intro**

This project is about implementing Classes and basic JS.I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. 

"Around The U.S" is a my seventh independent project in the Practicum100 program. This is a one web page made only with html, css and some basic JavaScript.
It has 6 unique sections and all the forms have validation!
more to that, it is well structured according to BEM principles.
